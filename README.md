Assignment 11: Group Project: Create a
Webpage with Organized CSS Styles
Setup
Groups will be selected by your instructor and consist of 3-4 members per group.
The preferred method of communication between yourself and your classmates will be
up to you and your group members. Email, Discord, or even group text messages are
excellent sources for asynchronous communication. You may also video conferencing
services like Zoom to organize live meetings with your group.
ï‚· Zoom's free tier limits calls between 3 or more participants to 45 minutes, but
you may simply restart the call for another 45 minutes if your call ends
prematurely.
You should select a leader for your group. The group leader will be responsible for
creating and setting up the GitHub repository, as well as reviewing pull requests. The
group leader will also have the final say over design and implementation details for your
project in the event the group cannot reach a consensus on a particular decision. That
said, the group leader should ensure that all group members are encouraged to
contribute to the design and development of the project.
The group leader will also be responsible for creating a git repository with a
professional-sounding title and adding each group member to the repository as a
contributor.
The group leader will also set up a branch protection rule for the main branch and
ensure at least one contributor must approve changes before merging the pull request
into the main branch.
Each group member will then clone the project repository to his/her computer. When
working on the project, each member should create a branch locally for a feature he/she
is working on, using git commits as necessary for any completed milestones on the way
to implementing the desired feature. Then, the group member should push the changes
to GitHub and create a pull request to be reviewed by the other group members before
merging to the main branch.
Allowing group members to push changes directly to the main branch is
strongly discouraged.
Instructions
For this project, you and your group will design, code, and deploy a website for or
related to your favorite movie or TV show. To receive full-credit for this project, your
group must create and submit:
1. A style guide for your website.
2. Any wireframes or mockups that were used in the creation of your site.
3. A website for or related to a TV show or movie that has at least 4 unique pages.
2
The submitted website must also:
1. Be responsive on both tablet and cell-phone sized screens.
2. Use CSS flexbox at least once.
3. Use semantic HTML tags where appropriate.
4. Utilize BEM naming conventions for its CSS rules.
5. Include at least one usage of CSS transitions.
6. Include at least one usage of CSS animations.
7. Include a README in the GitHub repository for the project that details any
challenges encountered during development as well as a link to the deployed
website.
Additionally, all group members must have a similar amount of git commits to
the project to receive full-credit. The instructor will review the git history of
the project on GitHub to ensure that all group members fairly contributed to
the project. Any glaring disparities in the commit history of the project must
be justified in the README for the project.
Deployment
Your group leader must deploy your site to GitHub Pages. To deploy a repository to
GitHub pages:
1. Ensure your repository has an index.html file in the root directory.
2. Navigate to the settings section of the repository.
3. Click on pages in the left navigation menu.
4. Under source click the dropdown and select your master or main branch.
5. Click save.
Your site should be deployed to <your leader's github username>.github.io/<your
repository name> in 5-10 minutes.
